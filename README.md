# fullfix-test

1) Used scss which is compiled via grunt to style the page
2) Used getJSON to inject the json data for the slides, might not be a perfect implementation but this is the first time I have had to use json ever
3) Please use localhost to view the page as there's the ajax call for the json data or view the page on firefox where this isnt required
